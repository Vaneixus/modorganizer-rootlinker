###### Please note that the Script is not related in any ways to the Mod Organizer Team and is not considered as "Official Plugin" of the Manager, it's a Third Party Plugin and is currently in Active Development

# Description:
Ever wanted to use different ENB Presets without going through the hassle of cleaning up your game installation of the previous ENB or maybe keep your game installation clean of clutter like Bodyslide files and other useless folders/files and wanted to use MO2's own awesome mods system but soon was disappointed that the system is limited to only the data folder? then found multiple tools for ENBs and such files but they were all standalone? Well you're not alone! I have just got the answer to your needs!


# Features:

* Support for Multiple Games like Fallout 3, Fallout New Vegas, Fallout 4, Skryim SE, etc(As long as they are supported by MOD Organizer 2)
* Support for Mounting using MO2's Managed Mods.(so files can be disabled using just a tick!)
* Prioritized loading using mod's load order.
* Able to detect changes starting from game/App launch until exit and move them to the instance's Overwrite folder.
* Auto Cleanup of the Overwrite folder.
* Basic Support of DLLs(Not to be expected to work with New Games using the Creation Engine or with certain DLLs)


# How to Install:

 1. Download the file MANUALLY
 2. open the archive and copy the file named rootbuilder.py
 3. Paste into MO2's Plugin folder, usually located at MO2's Installation Directory(Not Instance folder)
 4. Enjoy!


# How to Use:

 1. Create or use an existing Managed Mod.
 2. Open desired Mod's folder.
 3. Create a new folder named "Root"(Without quotation marks)
 3. paste any and all desired files and folders into the new folder.
 5. You're done!
P.S: Please note that any "Root" folder containing a data folder will be ignored to avoid problems with MO2.


# Planned Features:

 * Support for proper mounting of DLLs(like ENB Binaries & Script Extender)(Not currently to be expected to work)
 * Native Detection of certain directories outside "Root" folder for automatic mounting to game game directory
